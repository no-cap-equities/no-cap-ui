# Data Layer Implementation Status

## Overview

We've successfully implemented the core data models and API layer for the No Cap equity management platform. This document outlines what has been completed and the current state of the data layer.

## Completed Components

### 1. Core TypeScript Interfaces (`/types/index.ts`)

Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all core entities:
- Company, Stakeholder, Security, Grant, Transaction
- Approval workflows with multi-party support
- Cap table structures with ownership tracking
- Compliance entities including rules, filings, and jurisdictions
- Treasury management with multi-currency support
- Activity tracking for audit trails
- Dashboard-specific data structures for different user roles

Key features:
- Proper discriminated unions for different types (SecurityType, TransactionType, etc.)
- Comprehensive type safety with strict typing
- Support for complex relationships between entities

### 2. Data Validation Utilities (`/lib/validation.ts`)

Implemented robust validation system:
- Type guards for all core entities
- Enum validators for all discriminated union types
- Complex entity validators with detailed error reporting
- ValidationError class for structured error handling
- Helper validators for common patterns (email, ethereum addresses, dates)
- Batch validation support for processing multiple entities

### 3. Data Transformation Utilities (`/lib/transforms.ts`)

Created comprehensive transformation utilities:
- Currency formatting (cents to USD, large number formatting)
- Date formatting and relative time calculations
- Cap table transformations for charts and visualizations
- Grant vesting calculations and progress tracking
- Transaction grouping and summarization
- Dashboard data transformations for each user role
- Chart data preparation for various visualization types
- Role-based data filtering capabilities

### 4. API Client Interface (`/lib/api.ts`)

Designed a comprehensive API client interface:
- Full CRUD operations for all entity types
- Specialized methods for complex operations (grant exercises, approval workflows)
- Dashboard-specific endpoints for different user roles
- Pagination and filtering support
- Error handling with custom ApiClientError class
- Request/response type safety throughout
- Utility methods for file uploads and data exports

### 5. Mock API Client Implementation (`/lib/api-client.ts`)

Implemented a fully-functional mock API client:
- In-memory data store for all entity types
- Sample data initialization for testing
- Simulated network delays for realistic behavior
- Error simulation for testing error handling
- Full implementation of the API client interface
- Support for complex operations like grant exercises and rule checking

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Type-First Approach**: All data structures are strictly typed with TypeScript interfaces
2. **Validation Layer**: Comprehensive validation ensures data integrity
3. **Transformation Layer**: Separates API data format from UI display format
4. **Mock Implementation**: Full mock client allows development without backend
5. **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns between types, validation, transformation, and API

## Next Steps

With the core data layer complete, the next phases include:
1. Implementing React Query hooks for data fetching
2. Setting up mock API routes in Next.js
3. Creating sample JSON data files
4. Implementing optimistic updates and caching strategies

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { createApiClient } from '@/lib/api';
import { validateCompany } from '@/lib/validation';
import { centsToUSD } from '@/lib/transforms';

// Create API client
const api = createApiClient();

// Fetch company data
const { data: company } = await api.getCompany('acme-inc');

// Validate the data
const validation = validateCompany(company);
if (!validation.valid) {
  console.error('Invalid company data:', validation.errors);
}

// Transform for display
const displayValue = centsToUSD(company.valuationUsd);
```

## Development Notes

- The mock API client includes sample data for testing
- Network delays are simulated in development mode
- Error conditions are randomly simulated for testing error handling
- All monetary values are stored in cents for precision
- Dates are stored in ISO 8601 format for consistency
