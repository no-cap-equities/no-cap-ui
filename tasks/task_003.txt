# Subtasks:
## 1. Design role selection cards [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create visual designs for the role selection cards that will appear on the landing page
### Details:
Design at least 3 distinct role cards (e.g., investor, creator, developer) with appropriate iconography, color schemes, and hover states. Each card should clearly communicate the role's purpose and benefits. Include both active and inactive states in the design.

## 2. Implement responsive layout structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the responsive HTML/CSS structure for the landing page that works across all device sizes
### Details:
Develop a flexible grid layout that adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports. Ensure proper spacing, typography scaling, and component repositioning based on screen size. Use CSS media queries to handle breakpoints appropriately.

## 3. Develop role selection component [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Build the interactive component that allows users to select their role
### Details:
Implement the role selection cards as interactive components that highlight on hover and can be selected. Store the selected role in application state. Include validation to ensure a role is selected before proceeding.

## 4. Create entrance and transition animations [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Implement smooth animations for page load and role selection transitions
### Details:
Design and implement entrance animations for the landing page elements (fade-in, slide-in, etc.). Create smooth transitions when users select different roles. Ensure animations are subtle and enhance rather than distract from the user experience.

## 5. Implement blockchain connection visuals [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Create visual indicators for blockchain connection status
### Details:
Design and implement subtle visual indicators showing blockchain connection status (connecting, connected, disconnected). Include appropriate loading states and error handling for connection issues. These should be non-intrusive but informative.

## 6. Integrate with authentication flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Connect the role selection process with the user authentication system
### Details:
Integrate the selected role with the authentication flow so that user permissions and experience are tailored to their role. Implement the necessary API calls to store the selected role with the user profile. Handle authentication redirects appropriately.

## 7. Implement role-specific content previews [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.6
### Description: Create dynamic content previews that change based on selected role
### Details:
Develop a system that dynamically updates content previews on the landing page based on the selected role. This should give users a glimpse of what their experience will be like after selecting a specific role. Include relevant metrics, features, or benefits for each role.

## 8. Perform cross-browser testing and optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7
### Description: Test the landing page across different browsers and optimize performance
### Details:
Test the landing page on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and ensure consistent functionality. Optimize animations and transitions for performance. Ensure loading times are minimized and the page is accessible according to WCAG standards.
