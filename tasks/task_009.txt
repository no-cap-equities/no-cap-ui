# Task ID: 9
# Title: Multi-Party Approval Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the approval workflow system with visual flow diagram, approval actions, delegation capabilities, and activity tracking for equity transactions.
# Details:
1. Create approval detail route at `/app/(routes)/approvals/[requestId]/page.tsx`
2. Build AvatarFlow component for visualizing approval sequence
3. Implement ApprovalDocViewer for document review
4. Create DiffOwnershipChart showing before/after impact
5. Build ActionButtons for approve/reject/delegate actions
6. Implement HistoryTimeline for tracking approval activity
7. Create API integration with `/api/mock/approvals/:id`
8. Implement optimistic UI updates for approval actions
9. Build notification system for pending approvals
10. Create delegation modal for reassigning approvals
11. Implement server-sent events for real-time updates

# Test Strategy:
1. Test approval flow visualization with different scenarios
2. Verify approval actions (approve, reject, delegate)
3. Test document viewer functionality
4. Validate history timeline updates
5. Test notification system for approvals
6. Verify real-time updates with multiple users

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define approval workflow states and transitions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define all possible states in the approval workflow (draft, pending, approved, rejected, etc.) and the valid transitions between them.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive state machine that covers all possible approval scenarios. Include edge cases like cancellations, revisions, and expired approvals. Document the business rules that govern transitions between states.

## 2. Create visual workflow diagram [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Design a visual representation of the approval workflow that clearly shows all states and transitions.
### Details:
Use a flowchart tool to create a clear, professional diagram. Include color coding for different types of states and actions. Ensure the diagram is suitable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## 3. Design approval action interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Design the UI components for approval actions (approve, reject, request changes, etc.).
### Details:
Create mockups for approval buttons, confirmation dialogs, and comment fields. Ensure the design is intuitive and prevents accidental actions. Include mobile-responsive designs.

## 4. Implement document viewing capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the functionality to view documents requiring approval within the workflow system.
### Details:
Implement secure document rendering for various file types (PDF, DOCX, images). Include zoom, page navigation, and annotation features. Ensure documents load efficiently even when large.

## 5. Develop core approval workflow engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Build the backend logic that manages workflow states, transitions, and validation rules.
### Details:
Implement the state machine defined earlier as a robust backend service. Include validation logic for each transition. Design for extensibility to allow new states or rules to be added later.

## 6. Implement delegation capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Create functionality allowing approvers to delegate their approval authority to others.
### Details:
Build delegation features including temporary and permanent delegation options. Include controls for delegation limits, expiration, and revocation. Implement notification systems for both delegator and delegate.

## 7. Develop real-time activity tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Implement a system to track and display all workflow activities in real-time.
### Details:
Create an event-based system that captures all workflow actions. Implement real-time updates using WebSockets or similar technology. Design an activity log that shows who did what and when.

## 8. Create notification system [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.5, 9.7
### Description: Develop notifications for approval requests, status changes, and approaching deadlines.
### Details:
Implement multi-channel notifications (email, in-app, mobile push). Create templates for different notification types. Include preference settings for users to control notification frequency and channels.

## 9. Implement reporting and analytics [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.7
### Description: Build reporting features to track approval metrics and identify bottlenecks.
### Details:
Create dashboards showing approval times, rejection rates, and bottlenecks. Implement filters for different time periods and organizational units. Include export functionality for reports.

## 10. Develop audit trail functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.5, 9.7
### Description: Create a comprehensive audit system that logs all actions within the approval workflow.
### Details:
Implement tamper-evident logging of all system actions. Include user information, timestamps, IP addresses, and before/after states. Create interfaces for authorized users to review audit trails.

## 11. Conduct integration testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9, 9.10
### Description: Test the complete approval workflow system with all components working together.
### Details:
Create test scenarios covering the entire approval lifecycle. Test edge cases like simultaneous approvals and system outages. Verify real-time updates and notification delivery. Conduct performance testing under load.
