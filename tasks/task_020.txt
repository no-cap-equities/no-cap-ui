6. Verify error tracking and monitoring
7. Conduct security penetration testing

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define End-to-End Testing Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive testing strategy document that outlines the approach for testing all user flows and system integrations.
### Details:
Document should include test coverage goals, testing tools selection (e.g., Cypress, Selenium), test environment requirements, and critical user journeys to be tested. Define success criteria for each test scenario.

## 2. Implement Automated End-to-End Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Develop automated test scripts that validate all critical user flows and system integrations.
### Details:
Create test scripts for user registration, authentication, content creation, search functionality, and any other core features. Include both happy path and edge case scenarios. Ensure tests are maintainable and properly documented.

## 3. Set Up Containerization with Docker [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create Docker configuration files for containerizing the application and its dependencies.
### Details:
Develop Dockerfile for the application, configure Docker Compose for local development and testing environments. Ensure proper environment variable management and optimize container size and performance.

## 4. Configure CI Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2, 20.3
### Description: Set up continuous integration pipeline to automatically build, test, and validate code changes.
### Details:
Configure CI tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) to trigger on code commits, run unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Include code quality checks, linting, and security scanning. Set up proper notification system for build failures.

## 5. Configure CD Pipeline for Google Cloud [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.4
### Description: Establish continuous deployment pipeline to automatically deploy validated changes to Google Cloud environments.
### Details:
Set up deployment stages for development, staging, and production environments. Configure Google Cloud Build or similar tools. Implement deployment approval gates and rollback mechanisms. Document the deployment workflow.

## 6. Set Up Google Cloud Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Configure necessary Google Cloud resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
### Details:
Use Terraform or Google Cloud Deployment Manager to provision required resources (e.g., GKE clusters, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage). Implement proper network security configurations, IAM roles, and resource scaling policies.

## 7. Implement Application Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.5, 20.6
### Description: Set up comprehensive monitoring for application performance, errors, and user experience.
### Details:
Configure Google Cloud Monitoring, set up custom dashboards, implement logging strategy, and create alerting policies. Include metrics for application performance, database performance, API response times, and error rates. Set up proper log aggregation and analysis.

## 8. Implement Security Scanning and Auditing [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.5
### Description: Set up automated security scanning tools and processes for continuous security validation.
### Details:
Implement dependency vulnerability scanning, container image scanning, and code security analysis. Configure regular security audits and penetration testing schedule. Document security findings remediation process.

## 9. Create Disaster Recovery Plan [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.6, 20.7
### Description: Develop and document procedures for backup, recovery, and business continuity.
### Details:
Define backup strategy and schedule, implement automated backup procedures, document recovery processes, and establish RTO/RPO objectives. Create runbooks for common failure scenarios and test recovery procedures.

## 10. Conduct Load and Performance Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.5, 20.7
### Description: Perform comprehensive load testing to validate system performance under expected and peak loads.
### Details:
Define performance benchmarks, implement load testing scripts using tools like JMeter or Locust, simulate various load scenarios, identify performance bottlenecks, and document optimization recommendations. Test auto-scaling capabilities of the cloud infrastructure.
