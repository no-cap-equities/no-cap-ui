# Task ID: 2
# Title: Authentication System with Alchemy Account Kit
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the authentication system using Alchemy Account Kit for wallet connections with optional email/SSO stub for alternative login methods.
# Details:
1. Install Alchemy Account Kit: `npm install @alchemy/aa-core @alchemy/aa-accounts`
2. Create authentication provider component in `/components/providers/auth-provider.tsx`
3. Implement wallet connection flow with Alchemy Account Kit
4. Create authentication hooks in `/hooks/use-auth.ts`
5. Build authentication modal component with provider options
6. Implement session management with role context
7. Create protected route middleware
8. Add email/SSO stub as alternative authentication method
9. Implement sign out functionality
10. Create authentication state in Zustand store

# Test Strategy:
1. Test wallet connection with test accounts
2. Verify session persistence across page refreshes
3. Test role-based access control
4. Validate authentication state management
5. Test sign out functionality
6. Verify protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
