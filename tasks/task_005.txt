# Task ID: 5
# Title: Visualization Components and Chart Library
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop reusable chart components using Recharts for cap table visualization, including pie charts, bar charts, line graphs, and other data representations.
# Details:
1. Install Recharts: `npm install recharts`
2. Create base chart components in `/components/charts/`:
   - PieChart for ownership distribution
   - BarChart for comparative analysis
   - LineChart for time-series data
   - BubbleChart for portfolio visualization
3. Implement responsive chart containers
4. Create chart color utilities that use CSS variables
5. Build interactive tooltip components
6. Implement animation configurations
7. Create chart legend components
8. Build chart export functionality (PNG, CSV)
9. Implement accessibility features for charts
10. Create chart skeleton loaders for loading states

# Test Strategy:
1. Test charts with various data sets
2. Verify responsive behavior across screen sizes
3. Test interactive features (tooltips, clicks)
4. Validate export functionality
5. Test accessibility with screen readers
6. Verify color scheme consistency with design system

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up project structure for Recharts components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the initial project structure for reusable chart components using Recharts library
### Details:
Initialize the project structure with appropriate folders for components, utilities, and types. Set up necessary dependencies including Recharts and any supporting libraries. Create basic documentation structure and component API guidelines.

## 2. Implement base chart configuration system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop a configuration system that will be shared across all chart types
### Details:
Create a flexible configuration system that handles common chart properties like dimensions, margins, colors, animations, and theming. Implement prop validation and default values. Design the system to be extensible for all chart types while maintaining consistency.

## 3. Develop pie chart component for ownership visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create a reusable pie chart component to visualize ownership distribution in cap tables
### Details:
Implement a pie chart component with customizable segments, labels, and tooltips. Include features for highlighting segments, showing percentages, and handling edge cases like many small segments. Ensure the component works with cap table data structure for ownership visualization.

## 4. Build bar chart component for comparative metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Develop a bar chart component for comparing metrics across different equity classes or time periods
### Details:
Create a bar chart component supporting horizontal and vertical orientations, grouped and stacked configurations. Implement features for sorting, filtering, and customizing bar appearance. Ensure it can effectively display comparative cap table metrics like ownership by class or changes over funding rounds.

## 5. Implement line graph for historical equity trends [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create a line graph component to visualize changes in equity distribution over time
### Details:
Develop a line graph component with support for multiple series, customizable line styles, and data point markers. Implement zoom and pan capabilities for exploring historical data. Include features for displaying significant events like funding rounds or exits on the timeline.

## 6. Add interactive features and tooltips [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Enhance all chart components with interactive features and detailed tooltips
### Details:
Implement consistent interactive behaviors across all chart types including hover effects, click actions, and tooltips. Create customizable tooltip components that display relevant data points and calculated metrics. Add support for drill-down interactions to explore detailed information.

## 7. Implement responsive design for all chart components [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Ensure all chart components are fully responsive across different screen sizes
### Details:
Add responsive behavior to all chart components using Recharts' responsive container. Implement adaptive layouts that optimize for different screen sizes. Create fallback visualizations for very small screens where detailed charts may not be readable.

## 8. Develop chart export and sharing functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.6, 5.7
### Description: Add capabilities to export charts as images or data and share them
### Details:
Implement functionality to export charts as PNG, SVG, or PDF. Add options to export underlying data as CSV or Excel. Create shareable links or embed codes for charts. Ensure exported visuals maintain high quality and include relevant context.

## 9. Implement accessibility features [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.6, 5.7
### Description: Ensure all chart components meet accessibility standards
### Details:
Add ARIA attributes to all chart components. Implement keyboard navigation for interactive elements. Ensure color schemes are accessible for color-blind users. Add screen reader support with meaningful descriptions of data visualizations. Test with accessibility tools and make necessary improvements.

## 10. Create comprehensive documentation and examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.8, 5.9
### Description: Develop detailed documentation and usage examples for all chart components
### Details:
Create comprehensive API documentation for all components. Develop a storybook or example gallery showcasing different chart configurations and use cases specific to cap table visualization. Include code snippets, prop tables, and best practices. Add performance optimization guidelines and troubleshooting information.
